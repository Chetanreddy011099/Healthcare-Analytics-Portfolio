-- ========== EHR Workflow Optimization â€“ Example SQL ==========
-- Notes: Adapt table/column names to your environment. 
-- Assume a wide encounters table for simplicity. For production, split into event tables.

-- 1) Basic cycle times per encounter
SELECT
  encounter_id,
  patient_id,
  provider_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (triage_start_ts - arrival_ts))/60.0              AS mins_arrival_to_triage,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (provider_note_start_ts - triage_start_ts))/60.0  AS mins_triage_to_provider,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (provider_note_signed_ts - provider_note_start_ts))/60.0 AS mins_provider_to_signoff,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (discharge_ts - provider_note_signed_ts))/60.0    AS mins_signoff_to_discharge
FROM encounters
WHERE arrival_ts IS NOT NULL;

-- 2) Summary stats to spot bottlenecks (by location or provider)
WITH cycle AS (

FROM encounters
GROUP BY 1

-- 4) Error/bounce rate (rework proxy)
SELECT
  location_id,
  AVG(errors_count)                         AS avg_errors_per_encounter,
  SUM(CASE WHEN errors_count > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::float / COUNT(*) * 100 AS pct_encounters_with_errors
FROM encounters
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY pct_encounters_with_errors DESC;

-- 5) SLA compliance view
SELECT
  encounter_id,

  CASE WHEN documentation_complete_flag = 1 THEN 'COMPLETE' ELSE 'INCOMPLETE' END                     AS doc_status
